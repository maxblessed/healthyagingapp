          Healthy aging is term used to refer to the quality of life that one lives during ones elder years. For example, someone who is aging healthy is actively engaged in social events, physical active, and eating healthy. Healthy aging can also be a state of mind. If one is constantly thinking "I’m old" then one will feel old.
        the key to healthy aging is a healthy lifestyle. Eating a variety of nutritious foods, practicing portion control and including physical activity in your daily routine can go a long way toward promoting healthy aging.
       Aging is a natural part of life that can not be avioded. However, the foods you eat can help you age better, both inside and out.
       </p>
       <h2>HERE ARE OUR TIPS TO HEALTHY AGING</h2>
       <div>
         <div>
           <h4>Green Tea</h4>
           <p>Green Tea is high in antioxidants, which can protect against free radicals.

              Free radicals are unstable molecules that form during metabolism and in response to stress. Antioxidants change their structure so they're unable to cause damage.
              
              Green tea is particularly high in antioxidants called polyphenols, which can fight diabetes, insulin resistance, inflammation and heart disease.
              
              Polyphenols may also help protect collagen, the main protein in your skin. This may reduce and even partly reverse some signs of aging.
              
              In one study, women with sun-damaged skin who were treated with green tea cream and supplements for 8 weeks had modest improvements in skin elasticity</p>
              <h6> <i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> NOTE</h6>
              <p>Green tea has strong antioxidant properties that protect your skin's collagen from sun damage and may reduce signs of aging.</p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <h4>Aerobic Exercise</h4>
            <p>Aerobic exercise increases circulation throughout the body and strengthens the heart and lungs.  It aids in digestion, helps us reduce anxiety and stress, and enhances the quality of our sleep. Weight-bearing aerobic exercise, such as walking, jogging, hiking or dancing, can improve healthy aging</p>
            <h6> <i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> NOTE</h6>
            <p>Aerobic Exercise keep your body fit, strong and active. it reduce weakness and tiredness of the body</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>Vegetables</h4>
            <p>Vegetables are extremely nutrient-dense and very low in calories.

                They contain antioxidants that help reduce the risk of heart disease, cataracts and cancer.
                
                Many vegetables are also high in carotenoids like beta carotene. These can protect against sun radiation and free radicals, both of which can lead to skin aging.
                
                Some of the best sources of beta carotene are carrots, pumpkin and sweet potatoes.
                
                Many vegetables are also rich in vitamin C, which is important for collagen production and has strong antioxidant effects.
                
                In one study, when people were given 180 mg of vitamin C daily for 4 weeks, their skin's antioxidant activity increased by 37%.
                
                Vegetables with the highest vitamin C content include leafy greens, bell peppers, tomatoes and broccoli.
                
                In another study, researchers measured elasticity and other skin qualities in more than 700 Japanese women. They found that those who ate more green and yellow vegetables had fewer wrinkles.</p>
            <h6> <i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> NOTE</h6>
            <p>Vegetables provide sun protection and may prevent free radical damage to skin. This is largely due to their strong antioxidant effects.</p>
          </div>
            <div>
              <h4>Lifestyle Activities</h4>
              <p>Lifestyle activities, such as golf, gardening, bowling, tennis and ballroom dancing involve both physical and mental stimulation, keeping both our bodies and minds young. In general, experts agree that the more you can move--even if it's not as intense as traditional forms of exercise--the better off your body and your mind will be as you age.</p>
              <h6> <i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> NOTE</h6>
              <p>Exercise help to keep our body and mind active. The more active your body and mind the more younger you become</p>
